== Details ==

The issue tracker has become too clogged with bugs and I don't have time to deal with it.  So could everyone report issues with iNdependence 1.4 beta on this page instead.


== Current Known Issues ==

  * Wallpaper customization does not work with firmware 1.1.3
  * iNdependence almost always hangs after creating the RAM disk file.  It never gets to the jailbreak/activate/SIM unlock stage after creating the RAM disk.  It just sits there at the "Waiting for jail break" dialog.  *WORKAROUND*: Quit and restart iNdependence, then try again.
  * iNdependence will not work properly when run from the disk image.  There is no way around this because it needs to create a file within it's application bundle, and it can't do that when it's run from the disk image.
  * I'm unsure about how the new SIM unlock interacts with a phone previously SIM unlocked using iPhoneSimFree.  Anyone who wants to risk this and try it out, please post the results.
