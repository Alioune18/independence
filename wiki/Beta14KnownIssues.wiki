== Details ==

The issue tracker has become too clogged with bugs and I don't have time to deal with it.  So could everyone report issues with iNdependence 1.4 beta on this page instead.


== Current Known Issues ==

  * Wallpaper customization does not work with firmware 1.1.3

  * Google maps current location feature will not work.  This is because when iNdependence SIM unlocks your phone, it installs baseband 04.02.13_G, and this (older) baseband doesn't support that feature.

  * iNdependence almost always hangs *after* creating the RAM disk file.  It never gets to the jailbreak/activate/SIM unlock stage after creating the RAM disk.  It just sits there at the "Waiting for jail break" dialog.  If you don't see the screen of your phone change for more than a couple of minutes after you see the "Waiting for jail break" message, then it's likely frozen.

  WORKAROUND: Quit and restart iNdependence, then try again.

  * iNdependence will not work properly when run from the disk image.  There is no way around this because it needs to create a file within it's application bundle, and it can't do that when it's run from the disk image.

  * I'm unsure about how the new SIM unlock interacts with a phone previously SIM unlocked using iPhoneSimFree.  Anyone who wants to risk this and try it out, please post the results.

  UPDATE: It seems that if you do this, it will work, but you need to run Signal.app each time your phone boots to make it work with the IPSF unlock.

  UPDATE2: fruiteatingbear reports that his previously IPSF unlocked phone works fine after SIM unlocking via iNdependence.  No need for Signal.app

  * Sometimes, if you Activate and then SIM Unlock right afterwards, the SIM Unlock step will only do a jailbreak (not actually SIM Unlock the phone).  If you see "Jailbreak succeeded" after SIM Unlocking, then it didn't work.  If you SIM Unlock a second time, it should work.

  * The "Generating RAM disk" stage can take a long time.  If you want to see what's happening during this stage, run /Applications/Utilities/Console.app and check the Console.log file.  It's likely that you are downloading the 1.1.2 firmware file.  iNdependence will not be frozen up while it's generating the RAM disk.

  * However, iNdependence can freeze up when it's attempting to jail break and SIM unlock.  If the screen on your phone hasn't switched to the Apple logo within 30 seconds, then it's likely frozen.  You'll need to force quit and restart iNdependence (Alt+Option+Esc, select iNdependence, press "Force Quit").  This is a long-standing bug, and it's due to a faulty API in the iTunes library it uses (MobileDevice).

  * If you were previously SIM unlocked, you will need to do a SIM unlock again after upgrading to 1.1.3.  TurboSIM doesn't work under 1.1.3, and even the IPSF SIM unlock doesn't work without Signal.app.

  * Some people are reporting that when they do a jail break or SIM unlock, the phone boots to text mode, but then hangs and displays the same message over and over again (BSD root: md0, major 2, minor 0).  This is currently being investigated (I'm unable to reproduce it).  To get out of this mode, you need to manually put your phone in DFU mode (using the Power + Home buttons), then use iTunes to restore your firmware.

  UPDATE: I think that something bad is happening while iNdependence is creating the RAM disk file and people are ending up with an invalid RAM disk.  In Finder, right-click on iNdependence.app, select "Show Package Contents", then go to Contents -> Resources.  Delete the file called "ramit112.dat".  Now run iNdependence again.

  UPDATE2: If you are comfortable with the command-line and you really want to see what's happening, open up /Applications/Utilities/Terminal, navigate to the iNdependence.app/Contents/Resources/ folder, then type "./generate112ramdisk.sh ramit112_files.zip zero_file.zip ramit112.dat"

  UPDATE3: If you aren't comfortable with the command-line, but still want to see what's happening, after you have deleted "ramit112.dat", open up /Applications/Utilities/Console, make sure you are viewing the Console.log, then run iNdependence, and try to jail break.  You should see the output from the RAM disk creator script in the Console.

  * If a phone has been previously jailbroken with ZiPhone, iNdependence will say that it's still jailed.  The reason for this is because ZiPhone does not create the AFC2 service on the phone.  The AFC2 service allows computer-based applications to write to all areas of the phone (not just the Media partition).  So really, ZiPhone only jailbreaks for applications which run on the phone itself (not applications which run from the computer).

  * iNdependence currently does not put Installer.app on your phone.  You'll need to find a standalone copy and use SSH to copy it over to the phone.  I am considering adding some sort of feature for this.

  * If Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/Phone aren't working after performing a SIM unlock, then it's likely that gunlock failed at some point and left your baseband in a bad state (I've had this happen).  However, iNdependence won't detect this failure and will still report that SIM unlock worked.  If this happens, just do a SIM unlock again.  gunlock should work properly the second time around.  NOTE: You can tell that gunlock works if you see a lot of messages on the phone which say "Wrote: 0x800 ...".  If you don't see those messages, then it likely failed.

== Getting Installer.app onto Your Phone ==

(From john.angus - slightly modified by me)

How I got installer.app working:

  # Get the latest version from here: http://repository.apptapp.com/packages/System/Installer.zip

  # Install the Installer.app file using iNdependence

  # SSH into your phone and issue the following commands:

    chmod 755 /Applications/Installer.app

    chmod 755 /Applications/Installer.app/Installer

*NOTE*: You do not need to do step #3 if the Installer.app permissions are set correctly on your Mac before you install it using iNdependence.  So technically, you could run those commands from Terminal on your Mac before you install it (adjusting for the correct path to where you downloaded Installer.app of course).
