= Introduction =

This page is to collect a list of websites which are distributing binary versions of iNdependence as part of their iPhone unlocking service, but are not making the source code publicly available (nor giving credit).  If you know of any others, please submit them here.

This also includes sites which are distributing ZiPhone without source code.  Although ZiPhone is not my application, large parts of it are based off of GPLed code (one example: the SIM unlocking code).  So by virtue of that, it is also covered under the GPL.  So while I have no right to enforce the license for it, I will still point out sites which are distributing it without making any source publicly available.

If you think your website is here in error, then let me know by posting here as well.
