= Introduction =

This page is to collect a list of websites which are distributing binary versions of iNdependence as part of their iPhone unlocking service, but are not making the source code publicly available (nor giving credit).  If you know of any others, please submit them here.

This also includes sites which are distributing ZiPhone without source code.  Although ZiPhone is not my application, large parts of it are based off of GPLed code (one example: the SIM unlocking app within it which uses GPL code that was originally part of anySIM).  So by virtue of that, ZiPhone is also covered under the GPL.  So while I have no right to enforce the license for it, I will still point out sites which are distributing it without making any source publicly available.

I'm being strict about this because the only reason we've come to this point with the iPhone (being able to fully unlock it) is because people have been open with information.  Now we get a bunch of profiteers who simply want to repackage everything and sell it.  Which is fine (I'm not anti-capitalism), but they what they need to do is share back to the community any work they add.  It's not about getting money from anyone, or trying to make people look bad, it's about moving knowledge forward as a group rather than duplicating effort by making all of our work private.  If the original developers had taken this approach, there would be no market to make profits from, and we'd have a bunch of fragmented efforts with a lot less success.

If you think your website is here in error, then let me know by posting here as well.
